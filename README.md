# Indoor Object Detection Using YOLO

This repository contains an implementation of **indoor object detection** using the **YOLO** (You Only Look Once) algorithm.  
It demonstrates how deep learning models can be used for fast and accurate object detection in indoor environments.  
The code is written in **Python** using **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** (depending on your notebook setup).

## Features

- **YOLO Algorithm**: Single neural network predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities.
- **Indoor Object Detection**: Specifically adapted for detecting objects in indoor scenes.
- **Real-time Performance**: Focus on achieving fast inference suitable for real-time applications.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Easily adaptable to different indoor datasets.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- OpenCV (for image processing and visualization)
